This project generates a CSS-only image renderer.

# Instructions
1. Make sure you have node.js installed.
2. Navigate to `./config.json` and tinker with the stuff inside to your heart's content. `filePath` could be a URL, or a relative path to a local file.
3. Run `node .` in this root directory.
4. Install the missing dependencies if there is any, go back to step 3 after installing them.
5. Launch `./index.html`, it should be an example project of the CSS-only image.
6. Copy `./integrated.html` only, or `./index.html` and `./stylesheet.css` into your project. Use them however you wish.

Note that all the other files are only necessary in the process of `stylesheet.css` creation and can be discarded once you no longer need to generate more CSS-only images.
