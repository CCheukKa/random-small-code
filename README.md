# random small code
 Just some small random personal coding projects. 

# description
 Most of the projects are done. Some of them I either gave up or never got to finish them myself.  
 Some straight up don't work so be on the lookout for that.  
 If the title of the project folder sounds weird, then it's becuase it is.  
 Don't expect too much, or rather anything at all.  

# instruction
 Ignore my bad coding habits.  
 For the HTML projects, use compiled.html if possible, page.html if not.  
 I use nodeJS to execute my code just for the sake of convenience, I don't use external libraries anyway so any compiler should work.  
 For the discord bots or other stuff with tokens, I've replaced the token values with `no lol` so do a replace if you want to use the bots.
